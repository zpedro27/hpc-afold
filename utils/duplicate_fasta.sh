# This script loops through all the .fasta
# files in the input directory and
# duplicates the sequences, adding '_1'
# to the name of the repeated entry.
# 
# Example call:
# $bash duplicate_fasta.sh folder/with/fasta/files/
#
# NOTE: make sure that the provided .fasta files
# end with an empty line, so that the duplicated 
# sequence is appended on a different line.
